# Restaurant-Landing-Page
This is my first HTML &amp; CSS project: a simple single-page restaurant landing page. It features a clean design with images of food, a clear navigation menu, and a call-to-action button for reservations. A great starting point for learning front-end development and practicing layout and styling skills.
